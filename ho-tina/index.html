                 <p>Dear Prospective Patient,</p>

                 <p>Welcome to my practice. My dream of becoming a reconstructive surgeon came into fruition early, as it originated from my own personal childhood surgeries. I grew up in Yardley, Pennsylvania and the suburbs of Washington, DC and ultimately attended the College of William and Mary as a 1693 Scholar. My undergraduate endeavors that included two medical mission trips to Nicaragua and Costa Rica fostered another priority in my life: a passion for service. The 1693 Scholars program made possible a pinnacle summer internship with Operation Smile Vietnam.</p>

                 <p>I continued my education at the University of Virginia School of Medicine where I was bestowed with a Global Health Scholar award that allowed me to return to Vietnam as a medical student to interview patient families and study the epidemiology of cleft lip and palate. I was immediately drawn to the intricate anatomy of the head and neck and reconstructive aspects of facial plastic surgery during my Otolaryngology rotation and matched at the University of Kansas Medical Center for residency.</p>

                 <p>My head and neck surgery residency training experience further clarified and strengthened my dream of becoming a facial plastic surgeon and enabled me the opportunity to participate in a medical mission trip in Antigua, Guatemala as a surgeon. I then pursued a fellowship in facial plastic and reconstructive surgery at the University of Illinois in Chicago and trained under Dr. Dean Toriumi and Dr. Steven Dayan, world-renowned leading authorities in rhinoplasty and injectable procedures.</p>

                 <p>As a fellowship-trained facial plastic and reconstructive surgeon and a board-certified head and neck surgeon, I specialize exclusively in the head and neck area. I enjoy both the reconstructive and cosmetic aspects of facial plastic surgery and strive to pursue achieving both form and function in my practice. I find each Mohs defect case to be a new suspenseful puzzle where the outcome is never the same. One of my favorite surgical procedures is rhinoplasty; it is one of the most difficult procedures in plastic surgery as it alters the central characteristic of the face and requires both a mathematical foundation and artistic intuition.</p>

                 <p>From the initial consultation, I make it clear to every patient my treatment approach and philosophy: keep it conservative and natural. My objective is to meet the reconstructive or rejuvenation goals of each patient with them leaving my office refreshed and confident without the rest of the world knowing what we exactly did. I believe my treatment philosophy is in line with the goals of care of many patients, as they desire to both look and feel good but in the context of staying true to themselves and their natural appearance. I am committed to dedicating the necessary time and effort in counseling every patient regarding their treatment goals and realistic expectations. It is important that I establish and maintain comfort and trust with each patient, as they are trusting and investing their face in me.</p>

                 <p>As an avid aficionado of Impressionist art, I always zero in on the finest details and then take a step back to take in the bigger picture—a perspective I also apply to my facial plastic surgery practice. As both a former surgical patient and a surgeon, I always keep with me the insight that the appearance of the scars often matters greatly to the patient and always strive to perform my best closure at the end of any surgery, to make every stitch count and be perfect. As a female facial plastic surgeon, I have the advantage of establishing and maintaining approachable, relatable, and empowering relationships with my patients, the majority of whom are female.</p>

                 <p>With my roots in my parents’ homeland of Vietnam and in my passion for service, I embody a service idealism in my facial plastic surgery practice of providing the best individualized care to my patients in greater Philadelphia and abroad. I invite you to seek an in-person consultation with me to discuss your cosmetic or reconstructive needs, and I look forward to meeting you soon!</p>

                 <p>
                     Sincerely, <br>
                     Thuy-Van Tina Ho, MD <br>
                     Facial Plastic Surgeon
                 </p>
