                             <p>Genetics, aging, sun exposure and lifestyle factors can impact skin’s elasticity, causing it to sag and wrinkle. A facelift is an excellent option for patients who want to tighten their facial skin and reduce wrinkles. During this procedure, Dr. Elsa Raskin will make small incisions around your ears, temples, and chin to alter the underlying fat and muscle. Once she has removed any surplus fat, she will tighten the muscle and gently pull the skin back into place, removing any excess tissue.</p>
                             <p>This surgery is usually performed on an outpatient basis and can take two to three hours to complete.</p>

                             <p>Body contouring helps patients transform various area of their body to improve their figure. This cosmetic procedure is highly sought after amongst patients who have lost weight, either naturally or using bariatric surgery, and therefore have been left with excess areas of fat and skin.</p>
                             <p>Stubborn areas of loose skin and fat pockets are typically fairly unresponsive to exercise, and they can only be improved using cosmetic surgery.</p>

                             <p>When I made the absolute decision to have a tummy tuck, I was still very anxious about every detail including choosing a plastic surgeon. I consulted a few from personal recommendations. I decided to consult with Dr. Raskin because of the responsiveness and professionalism of her Office Manager. After meeting Dr. Raskin, I immediately knew I would ask her to do my surgery. She is warm, kind, honest and witty. During surgery, she was concerned for an ongoing medical issue I have had as well as the cosmetic portion and made sure this was repaired. Post surgery, Dr. Raskin and her staff were always available to answer even the smallest question. The end result looks wonderful and I feel better than I than I have physically in many months.</p>
