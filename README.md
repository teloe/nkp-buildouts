# NKP Buildouts

### Client websites I built during my time with [NKP Medical Marketing](https://www.nkpmedical.com/).

Most projects were developed locally using npm / browser-sync.

To view any of these projects, run: 
``` git clone https://github.com/teloe/nkp-buildouts ```

cd into any project and run 
``` npm install ```

In project root, run: 
``` npm start ```

browser-sync should open the project files in your browser. select the index.html or internal.html files to view.
