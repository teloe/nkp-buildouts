                <h1>Breast Augmentation Boston</h1>
                <p>Augmentation mammaplasty, or breast augmentation, is one of the most popular plastic surgery procedures performed today. Breast augmentaion is designed to increase the size of the breasts and improve body proportion. Breast augmentation is not designed to lift sagging breasts, though for women looking to both lift and increase the size of the breasts, a breast lift procedure performed in conjunction with a breast augmentation is often done. Ideal candidates for a breast augmentation procedure are in good physical and mental health, are dissatisfied with the size of the breasts, and have realistic expectations for the procedure and outcome. Breast augmentation can also improve breasts which are asymmetrical and implants may also be used after mastectomy of to correct other breast deformities from birth or caused by injury or illness.</p>

                        <p>“I have been a patient of Dr. Darrow for 3 yrs. I started with fillers and and Botox, loved the result. Then I had my implants removed with a breast lift, the girls look amazing!!! Lastly I had a lip lift and so happy with the result! Dr Darrow could make The Wicked Witch look great and even offered me to buy a bat to keep the boys away.”</p>

                <h3>Let’s take a look at an example of the steps a typical breast augmentation procedure:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>First, anesthesia will be administered which will make you comfortable and numb to pain.</li>
                    <li>Next, the incision will be made. There are a number of incision placement options avail 
    able to you. You and your Plastic Surgeon will discuss these options and make your 
    decision prior to the procedure. Some Incisions placement options include: Inframammary  
    Incision (in the crease under the breast), Transaxillary Incision (in the armpit), and 
    Periareolar Incision (around the areola).</li>
                    <li>The implants will then be placed in through the incision. Again, you will have made your 
    choice between a Saline-filled or Silicone implant ahead of the procedure, as well as   
    chosen size, shape and texture of the implant. Saline implants are filled with a salt water 
    solution after they are have placed in position, while Silicone implants, which are filled with  
    an elastic gel, are placed pre-filled. Each option has its pros and cons and the decision is 
    simply that of each patients aesthetic desires. Patients must be 18 years of age to receive  
    Saline-filled implants and 22 years of age to receive Silicone implants, unless otherwise
    recommended for younger patients with reconstructive needs.</li>
                </ul>
