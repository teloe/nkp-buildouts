                                "I had two procedures done earlier this year by Dr. Mata. The tummy tuck was in January 2016 and following after in February, thigh lift. After working out so many years, it was the excess skin and fat I had removed. For all my future procedures and for friends and family, I definitely recommend Dr. Mata. Growing up with physicians in my family ( my mother was a Pediatrician), he has a wonderful disposition very reminiscent of the days when doctors cared and took all the time you needed to address concerns. Dr. Mata also made sure I was mentally prepared for the procedures and was 100% transparent with what I can expect. It's not a form of weight loss, but body sculpting. He has a very nurturing way about him as well. My healing experience has been the most positive under his care and the care of the staff. You are given written directions and the nurses will answer any questions you have. After the procedures, of course, new clothes feel great in smaller sizes, but it's not seeing the unwanted skin and fat, always getting larger sizes to disguise my trouble spots that brings me happiness. I have no regrets. I highly recommend Dr. Mata and I'm so...

Out of surgery I thought I was going to feel like crap but no I really did not have pain all my meds were ready for me so I was so confortable My swelling was going down daily. I feel great I highly recomed Dr. Mata."

She did such a spectacular job on my face, and ensured I felt comfortable at ALL times. She carefully listened and acknowledged all of my concerns with my troubled area on my face. I felt like she went above and beyond, considering how badly these nasty pores were. She recommended steps for aftercare and will defiantly come back for all of my facial needs with Danielle! Overall, the front staff was warm and welcoming. Love love love my results can’t stress it enough! Can’t wait to come back!"

I myself have been back 6 times in three weeks to check on my healing process to make sure it's done right! Most doctors only see you maybe once after a procedure to get a good after photo. Dr. Mata offers the best in care as he is more concerned that you are taking care of yourself and seeing your results. He coaches you the whole way through because he really cares. He is doing the most advanced procedures because he is always up on the latest in technology. Login to his Instagram account and you can see him in action giving details on just how  detailed his work is!! Thank you Dr. Mata for giving me the care and attention you do and let's not forget my natural results!"
