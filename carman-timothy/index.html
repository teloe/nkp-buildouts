                            <p>I just visited my dermatologist here who sends you her compliments stating that she has never before seen such an excellent hair restoration as the one you did for me, and she has seen many. My hair is growing like a weed (from the second procedure) and it has only been five months. TT</p>

                            <p>Once again, thank you for your excellent work that you have done for me, I really appreciate it! I can say this because I’ve had three other procedures done, and nothing compares with your expertise, professionalism, and just feeling very comfortable with the whole experience. You’re the best!! RJ</p>

                            <p>I am really glad that I decided to hold out to have the procedure done by you personally. If your practice needs a reference, please don’t hesitate to give out my email or phone number. Feel free to use any of this email for the testimonial portion of your website as well. Thank you again. I shall be in touch with a progress report! MJ</p>

                            <p>My results were spectacular!!! I can pull off some great heavy metal hairstyles. I have had nothing but compliments on the work you did for me and to be honest your one session blows away a couple sessions performed by the Bosley Medical Group that a wealthier friend of mine had done over the last 2 years.

                        <li>
                            <p>I can't thank you enough for the wonderful work you and your staff have done. Quite simply, I just don't even think about my hair anymore- it always looks great under any condition!! JR</p>

                <h1>Our Practice Philosophy</h1>
                <p>First and foremost, we view integrity as the cornerstone of the traditional Surgical Practice. As your surgeon, we are privileged to have you as our patient. We do not offer specials, gimmicks, or other inappropriate fanfare. We take your health, and your desire to improve the quality of your life, very seriously. The time-honored tradition of the doctor patient relationship forms the foundation of our practice.</p>
                <h2>A Skilled Surgeon with An Artist’s Eye</h2>
                <p>At La Jolla Hair Restoration we view the truly successful hair transplant procedure as 'The Artful Expression of Modern Surgical Technique'. Hence, your surgeon must be artistically talented as well as medically qualified. This is what differentiates one transplant surgeon from another. Our promise is to provide you with a level of artistry uncommon in the hair transplant profession.</p>
                <p>We are not about the obvious. The true artistry of a transplant procedure is to make it virtually undetectable… to avoid being obvious. In our practice setting, Dr. Timothy Carman will deftly create your hair transplant as an organically designed work of art that will stand the test of time. Talent and experience make the difference: talent as an artist, along with sound surgical experience focused on hair restoration exclusively. We maintain that artistic focus, individually tailoring it for one patient, one procedure per day. The focus on one patient per day avoids any possible compromise to the integrity of the procedure, a phenomena which may occur in “assembly line” practice settings.</p>
                <h3><strong>Our promise is to provide you with a level of artistry uncommon in the hair transplant profession, with results that will substantially improve the quality of your life!</strong></h3>
