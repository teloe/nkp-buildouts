# Project template files

Start a new project by first copying this directory:
```cp -r template/ <NAME-OF-NEW-PROJECT> ```

```cd``` into the new project root and run ```npm init```

Download dependencies by running 
```npm install --save-dev gulp gulp-sass gulp-postcss postcss autoprefixer cssnano gulp-imagemin gulp-sourcemaps eslint browser-sync```

For automatic vendor prefixes, add this to your package.json:
```javascript
browserslist: [
    "last 2 versions"
],
```

Be sure the gulpfile.js is located in the root of your project. Running ```gulp watch``` will start your server and you can begin working.
